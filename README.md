Buy2kart – E-Commerce Project Documentation
Repository Purpose

This repository is created to document the complete development journey of the Buy2kart e-commerce website.

The main goal of this repository is to maintain a step-by-step record of how the Buy2kart platform is being built — from domain registration to hosting, configuration, development, and deployment.

It is used to:

Track every stage of website creation

Record challenges faced during development

Document solutions and fixes

Maintain technical and operational notes

Provide a clear history of the project setup

This repository acts as the central documentation hub for the Buy2kart e-commerce system, helping in future maintenance, upgrades, and team collaboration.

All important activities related to the Buy2kart website will be documented here as the project grows.
